# android-planes-on-paper - android multiplayer mobile game

- This is a 2 player game in which each player has a 10 x 10 border marked with letters and numbers on which he places 3 planes in any configuration he wants without letting the opponent see his planes and another identical border in which he will keep track of his attack attempts.

- Unlike “Battleship” a similar famous board game, in this game, you don’t have to destroy the entire plane, but only the square with the cabin, if you hit it, you destroy the entire plane.

- If you hit a plane, that specific square will be marked with an X and if you miss, the square will be marked with a dot. Those are all the information the player will get, they will not know if a different plane was hit or how the plane looks like after they completely destroyed it.

- Connection is automatic, the user has to insert a nickname and press a button which will connect the player to another random player, from where the players will begin to configure their plains position, and only after both players are ready the game will begin. In order to play a game with a friend the user will have to create a private room which will generate a unique code, to join that private room, the other player will have to insert that specific code in order to connect.
